                <h1>About NaCo</h1>
                <p>I’m Junior Silubane, also known as NaCo, a dynamic Producer and DJ from Tsakane, East Rand, Johannesburg. My musical journey began at 13 when I taught myself to DJ. By 15, I was deeply involved in music production, a passion I’ve pursued with unwavering dedication ever since. Music is both my livelihood and my heartbeat. I’m known for my versatility, blending a rich mix of influences and refusing to be confined by genre boundaries. My commitment to innovation and passion for music define my distinct and evolving style.</p>
